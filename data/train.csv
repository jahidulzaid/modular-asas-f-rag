what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast are both broadcast algorithms that attempt to minimize the number of duplicates packets in the network compared to other algorithms like the simple flooding algorithm. the idea of reverse path forwarding is that each sender/node has an own spanning tree, but the other iss do not need to know them. the algorithm is based on a simple condition for each node. the node has to decide, whether the received packet sent over the best route, i.e. it used the edge the node would use to send it back to the sender/author or not. if this is true, the node resends this packet over all other edges, i.e. excluding the incoming one, otherwise, the packet is most likely a duplicate and it will be discarded. the reverse path broadcast goes a little further and the is sends the packet from the best route only to the nodes it is responsible for/the sender used before. if the is is on the best path between the sender and his neighbor node, i.e. it is responsible for it, it learns over time.","['purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).']",correct,1.0,the response correctly explains rpf and rpb and their purpose.

what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"the purpose of reverse path forwarding (rpf) is the prevention of loops in a network when a multicast is sent from a node. it works in the way that each node has the knowledge about which node it would use for sending a unicast packet due to unicast routing algorithms. when a multicast packet arrives at a node’s entry port, the node would forward the packet to all other nodes (except for the one where the packet arrived) only if the node would also use this very node for sending the incoming packets to its source. otherwise, the packet is discarded because it is most likely a duplicate. the purpose of reverse path broadcast is to send a broadcast over the network without the occurrence of loops. it works in a similar way like rpf but here, a receiving node doesn’t forward the packet to all other nodes. a receiving node instead only forwards the packet to the node it would also send a unicast packet to.","['purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).']",correct,1.0,the response correctly answers the purpose and the explanation for both broadcast types. rpf avoids loops not only in multicast but also in the broadcast.
what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcasting is done, to find the shortest way to each recipient of a multicast message while minimizing the amount of copies sent in a network.  both principles work on the same foundation:  each router has the information which path it would use for a unicast transmission. the sender then starts to broadcast a package to all its connected neighbors. the neighboring routers then determine, whether the incoming package has used the best route to reach him. the best route in this case, is the one you would normally use in a unicast transmission.  if the incoming package has not taken the best route, it is discarded as it is most likely a copy.   if it has taken the best route the router forwards the package.  at this point reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcasting differ from each other: rpf: if the package has used the best route, the router resends the message to all edges, not including the one from which the message came from.  rpb: if the package has used the best route, the router resends the message to those edges over which it would be the best route.","['purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).']",correct,1.0,the response correctly answers the purpose and the explanation for both broadcast types. the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast is not limited to multicasting but also used in broadcasting.

what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"reverse path forwarding (rpf) and reverse path broadcast (rpb) are techniques used in routers. they enable loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing. reverse path forwarding:  in this procedure, each node i checks whether an incoming packet from source q has been received on the connection on which node i also transmits its packets to q. if this is the case, then the packet is assumed to have been transmitted on the shortest route and it is forwarded on all other lines. if, on the other hand, a packet was received on a line other than the one on which data is transmitted to the sender, then it is assumed that it is a duplicate that did not take the shortest route. this duplicate is then discarded instead of being forwarded. reverse path broadcast:  rpb is an improvement on rpf. rpb not only evaluates the shortest path with respect to the interface where the multicast packets are received, but also influences the forwarding of data to the interface of the router. as a result, multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces where the next router is located in the reverse direction on the shortest path to the data source. rpb specifically checks whether the incoming packet arrives at the is through which the packets for this station/source are normally also sent.  if not, the packet is discarded directly. if yes, it will be further checked if the packet has taken the best path so far. if yes → select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source s (in reversed direction) if not → do not send over all edges (without the incoming one)","['purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).']",correct,1.0,the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast is not limited to the multicast but also used in broadcast. the explanation of rpf and rpb is correct.

what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcasting are both algorithms used for loop-free multi- and broadcast communication and therefore aim to be more efficient than simple attempts like flooding or individual sending of packets to every destination in the network. the idea of both algorithms is the use of so called “spanning trees” for each individual node in the network, which contain routes to every subnode in every subnetwork. since one intermediary system does only know his own spanning tree, but not the ones of the surrounding nodes, each router has to use its knowledge of optimal routing for certain destinations as a criterion for further transmission. for reverse path forwarding this means, that each node has to check the link on which an incoming packet is received. if this link is the optimal one, over which packets for this station are also usually sent, then node can assume that the packet has taken an optimal way up to it. as a consequence, it then re-sends the packet over all of its edges, but not the one on which the packet was received. if the packet on the other hand does not come over such an “optimal” link it gets discarded.  since re-sending over all edges seems not to be the most efficient way of multicast-routing, reverse path broadcast introduces a further check for packets that arrive over the optimal link as well as a limited re-transmission of packets: if a packet has taken the optimal path until this station, the station reroutes the packet over the optimal incoming link to the source in reversed direction. this means, that the receiving node looks up in its routing table over which link such a packet would normally be received. exactly this link is then used for rerouting the packet to the source instead of using all links as it is done before in reverse path forwarding. otherwise (so to say if the packet is not received on an optimal link or received on an optimal link, but has not taken an optimal path so far), the packet is not resent. this mechanism is implemented to limit the number of duplicates in the network - while reverse path forwarding retransmits over all edges (excluding the one on which the packet was received), reverse path broadcasting chooses the most suitable link for retransmission.","['purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).']",correct,1.0,the response correctly explains rpf and rpb and their purpose.

what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"reverse path forwarding and broadcast are methods for broadcast routing. they enable improved flooding: it is checked whether a copy of a data unit has been received. if this is the case, no forwarding takes place to avoid loops. reverse path forwarding (also called reverse path flooding) (rpf) is a variation of the method spanning tree. each sender has its spanning tree. the other nodes don't have to know the spanning tree. the assumption is that each router knows which path it would use for packets.  the rpf algorithm checks whether a packet arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station are usually also sent. if yes, then the algorithm assumes the packet went the best path until now and resends the packet to all edges but the incoming one. if not, it assumes that the packet is a duplicate and didn't use the best route. this duplicate is then not forwarded but discarded. the significant advantage of this algorithm is its simple implementation. if a node assumes that a packet will reach it first by the shortest route, all that needs to be done is to ensure that a receiver can detect duplicates. as soon as a duplicate is received, it is assumed that the shortest route did not receive the packet, and it is not forwarded. the disadvantage of this method is that some nodes receive the packet unnecessarily several times. the reverse path broadcast (rpb) is like rpf but with a specific selection of outgoing links. after the first check, the algorithm checks if the packet used the best route until then. if yes, it selects the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source s. if not, it won't send over all edges. reverse path broadcast (rpb) is an improvement on rpf. rpb not only evaluates the shortest path concerning the interface on which the multicast packets are received but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. as a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. to be able to decide about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths.","['purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).']",correct,1.0,the response correctly explains the purpose and concepts of rpf and rpb.

"what is ""frame bursting""? also, give 1 advantage and disadvantage compared to the carrier extension.","frame bursting is a feature of the shared broadcast mode. it allows the sender to transmit concatenated sequences of multiple frames in a single transmission. for example, we have eight packets and a buffer. we have to wait for all these eight packets to come and put them together on the line. if something is wrong, all of the eight packets have to be repeated.

disadvantage: if we only have to send one or two packets, we have to wait for eight packets to arrive, it takes a long time. so we artificially increase the end to end delay.
advantage: it allows us to ""burst"" a sequence of packets resulting in higher throughput without abandoning the transmission medium.

there is a trade-off between efficiency and the end to end delay we are going to send. if we introduce end to end delay at the lower layer, the upper layer cannot do anything about it; it cannot speed it up anymore even if desired. so, thus, this is possible but not entirely ideal.","['frame bursting reduces the overhead for transmitting small frames by concatenating a sequence of multiple frames in one single transmission, without ever releasing control of the channel.\nadvantage :it is more efficient than carrier extension as single frames not filled up with garbage.\ndisadvantage :need frames waiting for transmission or buffering and delay of frames']",correct,1.0,"the response correctly states the definition of frame bursting, including its pros and cons."

ucs: frames are sent from the sender to the receiver and no feedback is given whether the frame has reached the receiver or not. neither flow control nor connect/disconnect phase is implemented. this kind of l2 service is either used for l1 channels with very low error rate as all corrections have to be done on higher levels and are therefore more resource-intensive. 
another possible use are real time data transfers where velocity and timing errors are more critical than data errors. 

ccs: every frame sent from the sender has to be acknowledged by the receiver. therefore there is no loss of data. a timeout and retransfer window is implemented in the case that the acknowledgment signal is lost during the transmission. neither flow control nor connect/disconnect phase is implemented. furthermore, duplication errors can occur due to retransmit errors. this kind of l2 service is used for l1 channels with high error rates e.g. mobile communication.

the unconfirmed connectionless service sends data to the receiver, without announcing it (building up a connection) first in data frames without any flow control. because of the missing connection and flow control, it is possible that complete data frames can get lost.  
- confirmed connectionless service 
wheras the confirmed connectionless service sends the data frames and waits for an acknowledgement of the corresponding recipient. if the recipient confirms the data frame, the next data frame is being sent. if the recipient doesn’t answer for a long time, the data frame is being resent. if for some reason, the ackknowledgement gets lost, the recipient will eventually get a data frame twice, and will not be able to detect the duplication. the correction has to be made on a higher level. it is much slower than the unconfirmed, because of waittime for timeouts and ackknowledgement messages. 
- connection oriented service 
in the connection oriented service, the overhead is a lot higher, but the advantages are a detailed flow control, in which the recipient can detect duplicates, ask for a certain frame and can align the frames in the right order. and if the recipient reads slower than the sender transmit, it is possible to make a transmission. the participants first exchange a handshake and afterwards are transferring data. afterwards the connection is disconnected.","['1.unconfirmed connectionless - no ack, loss of data possible, no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n2.confirmed connectionless - with ack, no loss of data (timeout and retransmit instead→ duplicates and sequence errors possible), no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n3.connection-oriented - no data loss, duplication or sequencing errors. instead a 3 phased communication with connect and disconnect, and flow control']",correct,1.0,the response answers the services' names and differences correctly.

the data is send immediately on the contrary to the connection-oriented service. in unconfirmed conn. less service, you have to expect that 
the sent packet arrives but you have no feedback acknowledge-signal (ack) whether the packet arrived. 

for confirmed conn. less service, when data is send via data request and arrived (data indication), the receiver answers to the sender by an 
acknowledgement (ack) , so there is a feedback signal stating that data arrived successfully. 

so far (for unconfirmed and confirmed connection less service), data is send and acknowledged (for confirmed conn. less) immediately. 
there is no difference for connection, data or disconnection phases. by using connection-oriented service, you have requests and indications for connection
establishment, data transfer and the disconnection. instead of just sending data, you send a request first for establishing a connection, then
there is an indication (=able to receive) on the receiver and the receiver sends a response back, after that the sender has a confirmation.

within the first of these service classes, the data sent will arrive at the receiver without any acknowledgement of the sender. this means the sender does not know if the data arrives and if it is complete or not. so loss of data units is possible and there is no flow control. additionally, during the data transfer there is no real connection between sender and recipient. the data units are transmitted isolated in only one direction as an answer to the data request. 

2.	„confirmed connectionless service“
compared to the first, within the second service class the receiver will let the sender know about the successful transmission of the data. if there is no acknowledgement from the recipient within a certain time frame, the data units will be send again. so there will not be any loss of data. 
but because of the retransmission there might be duplicates and sequence errors.
futhermore, this means there is no flow control as in the first service class and also no real connection between sender and receiver. although the communictaion is not one-directional anymore. 

3.	„connection-oriented service“
in contrast to the other two service classes, the third option offers flow control and connection between the participants of the data transfer. this comes with the advantage of no errors due to lost, duplicated or sequenced data. 
to make this way of data transfer possible there is a 3-phased communication between sender and receiver. 
firstly, the connection between both is settled and the needed variables are initialised. so before sending any data both participants will get a confirmation from each other whether they are ready or not. after that, the actual data transfer will start which is mostly bi-directional. and if the data transfer is completed in the end, there is another request and confirmation  about the upcoming disconnection.","['1.unconfirmed connectionless - no ack, loss of data possible, no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n2.confirmed connectionless - with ack, no loss of data (timeout and retransmit instead→ duplicates and sequence errors possible), no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n3.connection-oriented - no data loss, duplication or sequencing errors. instead a 3 phased communication with connect and disconnect, and flow control']",correct,1.0,the response answers the services' names and differences correctly.

the difference between the connectionless and connection-oriented services is, that with the connection-oriented variant, there are three phases of communication. first the connection phase where sender and receiver get ready, then the data transfer phase, where the actual data is transferred and then a disconnection phase, so that sender and receiver can agree to end the communication.","['1.unconfirmed connectionless - no ack, loss of data possible, no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n2.confirmed connectionless - with ack, no loss of data (timeout and retransmit instead→ duplicates and sequence errors possible), no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n3.connection-oriented - no data loss, duplication or sequencing errors. instead a 3 phased communication with connect and disconnect, and flow control']",partially correct,0.75,"the response answers the services' names and differences correctly. but there is no common theme between them, the first difference is about acknowledgements and the second difference is about how a connection is established."

-unconfirmed, connectionless service: the transmitter just sends packages and acknowledges the possibility that data is lost on the communication way. there is no acknowledgement of receiving data, as well as no flow control. therefore, this kind of service does not need any kind of connect or disconnect phase. 
-confirmed, connectionless service: each packet requires an acknowledgement signal sent form the receiver to the transmitter afterwards. if this signal is received at transmitter or if it comes too late (after a certain time frame), the same package is sent again to the receiver. now, we have the possibility of duplicates and sequence errors due to retransmit.
-connection-oriented service: to avoid all kind of loss- duplicate or sequencing-error , this service needs 3-phased communication to establish a state-oriented virtual “circuit switching”: at the beginning, we have a connection initialization, then a process of sending and acknowledging packages followed by a distinct disconnection process. 

all in all it can be summarized, that all three services are different in the amount of of care that is spent for error protection and signal acknowledgment. therefore, the different services are used in different cases: unconfired, connectionless services are only used when we can rely on avery robust and stable connection (for example lans), while confirmed, connectionless and connection-oriented services are used in less reliable networks, for example mobile communication.","['1.unconfirmed connectionless - no ack, loss of data possible, no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n2.confirmed connectionless - with ack, no loss of data (timeout and retransmit instead→ duplicates and sequence errors possible), no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n3.connection-oriented - no data loss, duplication or sequencing errors. instead a 3 phased communication with connect and disconnect, and flow control']",correct,1.0,the response answers the services' names and differences correctly.

name the 3 service classes the data link layer offers and explain the differences between the classes.,"unconfirmed connectionless service:
in this service, the data that is sent by the sender is expected to arrive at the receiver, however, there is no feedback from the receiver's side. due to a lack of acknowledgement from the receiver side, there exists a possibility of data units getting lost. furthermore, in this service there is no flow control taking place and neither is there a possibility of connect/disconnect. this form of service is best suited for l1 communication channels with a very low error rate.

confirmed connectionless service:
this service is a form of bi-directional communication, where upon sending information the receiver responds with an acknowledgment of whether the information has been received or not. it is particularly used in applications where a high error rate is expected, such as for moving devices. similar to the unconfirmed connectionless service, no flow control or a connect/disconnect phase takes place. due to the additional acknowledgement here, no data loss is possible, however, duplication and sequencing errors are still possible

connection-oriented service:
as opposed to the connectionless services, the connection-oriented service operates with flow control, achieved by a 3-phase bi-directional communication (connect, transfer, disconnect). this prevents data loss, duplication of data or sequencing errors. this form of service requires some sort of connection management as both the sides agree to perform the communication.","['1.unconfirmed connectionless - no ack, loss of data possible, no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n2.confirmed connectionless - with ack, no loss of data (timeout and retransmit instead→ duplicates and sequence errors possible), no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n3.connection-oriented - no data loss, duplication or sequencing errors. instead a 3 phased communication with connect and disconnect, and flow control']",correct,1.0,the response answers the services' names and differences correctly.
name the 3 service classes the data link layer offers and explain the differences between the classes.,"unconfirmed connectionless service: 
there is no flow control and no connection between the sender and the receiver. the sender transmits isolated independent frames without any feedback from the receiver if the transmission was successful or not so loss of data units is possible without being corrected. both sides have to believe that the data was correctly transmitted. this can be used when the error rate is very low (often used in lan’s).

confirmed connection-less service:
there is still no flow control and no connection between sender and receiver established. correctly received frames will be acknowledged by the receiver and transmitted to the sender (ack) so there is no data loss. duplicates are possible due to the retransmission of data, if the ack is either transmitted too late or the transmission of the ack was corrupted. 
this service can be used, if the error rate of a communication is high.

connection-oriented service
this service is characterized by a three-phased communication consisting of the connection (1), the data transfer (2) and the disconnection (3). there is flow control so the amount of frames being transferred between two communication partners with different communication speed can be regulated so no side gets overwhelmed.","['1.unconfirmed connectionless - no ack, loss of data possible, no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n2.confirmed connectionless - with ack, no loss of data (timeout and retransmit instead→ duplicates and sequence errors possible), no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n3.connection-oriented - no data loss, duplication or sequencing errors. instead a 3 phased communication with connect and disconnect, and flow control']",correct,1.0,the response answers the services' names and differences correctly.

confirmed conn.less service is a bidirectional communication between sender and receiver. after a sender sends a frame, a receiver sends an acknowledgement as answer. in the case of loss data a frame will be retransmit (after timeout) as long as the sender gets an acknowledgement from the receiver. in confirmed conn.less service there is no flow control implemented.

in a confirmed connectionless service the receiver sends an acknowledgement when it receives a frame. so if no acknowledgement has arrived at the sender in a certain time window, the sender can assume that the data was lost and re-transmit the frame.

what is the “dynamic host configuration protocol (dhcp)”? what is it used for? ,"without dhcp or similar protocols, the administrator of a network element or computer needs to assign an unused ip address in the adequate network range to the device by hand.
dhcp is a protocol to ease this process and to provide network elements with an ip address in an automated way. this can be a manual or an automatic assignment. in manual mode, a specific ip address will be permanently assigned to a certain mac address. in automatic mode, an ip address will be temporarily assigned (lease) and freed if no renewal occurs. this provides efficient use of addresses without blocking addresses if no device uses it. the dhcp server is configured to manage a pool of possible ip addresses in the network and also knows other configuration data (e.g. dns, netmask).
the dhcp protocol also allows to configure the network elements with other important network details like dns servers, netmask, default router, and other items. if a network element needs to join a network, it sends a broadcast message (discover) to the network. a dhcp server picks this message up and provides the necessary information to the network element as described above. there should not be more than 1 dhcp server in a network. if the dhcp server resides on another lan segment, a dhcp relay agent can forward the respective messages to/from the dhcp server.","['the dynamic host configuration protocol (dhcp) is a network management protocol used in internet protocol (ip) networks, whereby a dhcp server dynamically assigns an ip address and other network configuration parameters to each device on the network. further, dhcp has largely replaced rarp (and bootp)\n\t uses of dhcp are: simplifies installation and configuration of end systems. allows for manual and automatic ip address assignment. may provide additional configuration information  (dns server, netmask, default router, etc.)']",correct,1.0,the response answers the definition and the usage of dhcp correctly. there can be more than 1 dhcp server for a subnet provided the address range is unique for both of them so that there are no overlapping addresses they can allot.

justification:

b => is the least probable because we have 2^6 = 64 possible outcomes, and the probability that exactly this one order appears will be only the case once and hence the probability is 1/64.

c => here we can use the binomial random variable function. with n = 6 and k = 3 we get the result (6, 3)^t*0.6^3*(1-0.6)^3= 0.27648

a => a already includes the the probability of c and b, and in additon you sum up the other combinations of outcomes where there are at least 3 h´s. knowing that you can conclude that the calculated probability will be the highest and hence the most probable.","['the correct sequence is bca , where b is the least probable. one of the following justifications should be given:\n\t\t● event b is a subset/part/special case of c, and c is a subset/part/special case of a\n\t\t● event b is more specific/strict than c and c is more specific/strict than a\n\t\t● an actual, correct calculation of the probabilities:\n\t\t○ p(b) = 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.4 * 0.4 *0.4 = 0.6^3 *0.4^3 = 0.013824 \n\t\t○ p(c) = (6 choose 3) * p(b) = 0.27648 \n\t\t○ p(a) = p(c) + p(y=4) + p(y=5) + p(y=6) = 1 - p(y=0) - p(y=1) - p(y=2)\n\t\t= (6 choose 3) * 0.6^3 * 0.4^3 + (6 choose 4) * 0.6^4 * 0.4^2 +(6 choose 5) *\n\t\t0.6^5 * 0.4 + (6 choose 6) * 0.6^6\n\t\t= 0.27648 + 15 * 0.020736 + 6 * 0.031104 + 1 * 0.046656\n\t\t= 0.8208 \n\t\t○ the answer may be rounded to up to 2 decimal places, e.g. p(b) = 0.01 or\n\t\tp(b) = 0.014\n\t\t○ it is also sufficient to give a formula without the actual calculation, if it is apparent that p(b) less than p(c) less than p(a), e.g. by stating p(c) = 20 * p(b)']",correct,1.0,the response correctly answers the order of the events with appropriate justification.

from event c, we know that p(c) = 0,26568 (exactly 3 h's).
so we have to look for the remaining paths with more than 3 h's
--> 22 paths where more than 3 h's occur in probability tree
i computed the probability of every path and summed it up to 0,668736.
then p(a) = p(c) + 0,668736

p(b) = 0,6 * 0,6 * 0,6 * 0,4 * 0,4 * 0,4

so the probability is 1,3824%. if you think about the probability tree for this experiment (flipping a coin 6 times) you go exactly the path in the tree which refers to the sequence hhhttt and calculate the probabilities to get the probability.

event c: we see exactly 3 h's

sum up the probability of all paths in the probability tree where exactly 3 h's occur
in general, the probability that 3 h's occur is 0,6 * 0, 6 * 0,6 * 0,4 * 0,4 * 0,4 = 0,013824
-> every path where exactly 3 h's occur has this probability
we have to determine in how many paths in the probability tree exactly 3 h's occur (order does not matter)
-> 20 paths in the probability tree

so p(c) = 0,013824 * 20

for event c the order is not relevant, which makes it more likely. event a is the most probable, due to the factor 0.6, because the probability of heads is on average more likely than tails.","['the correct sequence is bca , where b is the least probable. one of the following justifications should be given:\n\t\t● event b is a subset/part/special case of c, and c is a subset/part/special case of a\n\t\t● event b is more specific/strict than c and c is more specific/strict than a\n\t\t● an actual, correct calculation of the probabilities:\n\t\t○ p(b) = 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.4 * 0.4 *0.4 = 0.6^3 *0.4^3 = 0.013824 \n\t\t○ p(c) = (6 choose 3) * p(b) = 0.27648 \n\t\t○ p(a) = p(c) + p(y=4) + p(y=5) + p(y=6) = 1 - p(y=0) - p(y=1) - p(y=2)\n\t\t= (6 choose 3) * 0.6^3 * 0.4^3 + (6 choose 4) * 0.6^4 * 0.4^2 +(6 choose 5) *\n\t\t0.6^5 * 0.4 + (6 choose 6) * 0.6^6\n\t\t= 0.27648 + 15 * 0.020736 + 6 * 0.031104 + 1 * 0.046656\n\t\t= 0.8208 \n\t\t○ the answer may be rounded to up to 2 decimal places, e.g. p(b) = 0.01 or\n\t\tp(b) = 0.014\n\t\t○ it is also sufficient to give a formula without the actual calculation, if it is apparent that p(b) less than p(c) less than p(a), e.g. by stating p(c) = 20 * p(b)']",partially correct,0.75,"the response states the correct order of events. however, since event a includes event c, heads having a higher probability than tails is irrelevant (except when p(h) = 1 or 0, in such case all the three even probabilities become equal)."

hhhttt occurs. that's why b is the least probable event.
since there are more possible combinations of h and t for a or c, those events are more probable
than b. but since the combinations for seeing exactly three h's are more limited than for seeing at
least three h's, c is a lot less probable than a.
since p[h] = 0.6, we get the probability of tails showing up with

p[y=3] = 6!/(3!*(6-3)!) * 0.6^3 * 0.4^(6-3) = 0.27648

for event a, we have the same binomial distribution, but since we also accept h showing up more than 3 times, we add up the probabilities:

event c: then the probability of seeing exactly three h's as the probability for showing up a head is 0.6 so there is more chances that a head shows up so the probability of head is more so exactly three h's probability is also low.

- ipv4 only allows to specify ip addresses of 32 bit (4 bytes) in the following format:
a.b.c.d whereby a,b,c,d in [0-255]
which results in 4.294.967.296 possible different addresses according to wikipedia which is not sufficient anymore
- ipv6 allows to specify ip addresses of 128 bit length  (16 bytes) and does not solely include numbers. as a consequence,
ipv6 allows to support billion of end-systems due to larger address space (according to wikipedia 2^128 different ip addresses possible)

2. increase of security
- the protocol ipsec (internet protocol security) allows to achieve the security goals confidentiality, authenticity and integrity on the network level. for instance, this can prevent the manipulation of the ip source address or the content of the ip datagram (integrity protection).
- ipsec is supported by ipv6 by default

3. simplify protocol processing
- due to a simplified ip header in ipv6 the protocol processing becomes less complex for routers. in general one can say that the header of an ipv6 packet has less fields to process, e.g. the header checksum is removed (can be handled on layer 2 or layer 4). this results in a speed up processing time at routers.

what are the objectives of ipv6? please state at least 4 objectives. ,"the first main objective for the introduction of ipv6 was the support of more addresses in the network. while ipv4 with 4 byte addresses only allowed roughly about 4 billion participants, ipv6 enables up to 2^128 addresses, what should be enough for the next centuries. this enlargement of the address room became important with the introduction of mobile computing, smart home and internet of things. 
the second objective was to simplify the process of forwarding and building routing tables by simplifying the header of ipv6-addresses, which are now easier and faster to decode for routers. 
furthermore, the way ipv6 addresses are handled in a network allowed a higher level of security in comparison to ipv4.
ipv6 allows better guarantees for quality of service, especially for real time traffic. this is also due to changes of the header of such an ip-packet. 
another important lesson learnd from the development history of ipv4 and therefore a main objective for ipv6 was to make it adaptive to future developments: so the ipv6 protocol allows introduction of extension headers for future functionalities.","['to support billions of end-systems.\nto reduce routing tables.\nto simplify protocol processing with simplified header.\nto increase security.\nto support real time data traffic (quality of service).\nflow label, traffic class.\nto provide multicasting.\nto support mobility (roaming).\nto be open for change (future): extension headers for additional change incorporation.\nto coexistence with existing protocols.']",correct,1.0,all four objectives of ipv6 mentioned in the response are completely accurate.

what are the objectives of ipv6? please state at least 4 objectives. ,"to support billions of end-systems: ipv6 provides a larger address space for the growing internet; each device can get a specific address. 

to reduce routing tables: ipv6 aims for efficient routing and flexibility in the future.

to simplify protocol processing: since a new version is used, headers can be made less complicated by taking things out people don’t use -> simplified header.

to increase security: security means integrated. in the ipv4 era, security wasn’t a big issue because of the small number of networks, but now it is a big issue and needs to be resolved for the future success of the internet.

to support real-time data traffic (quality of service) -> flow label and traffic class.

to provide multicasting: in ipv4, only one destination address is supported. with ipv6, it is possible to send a packet to more than one.

to support mobility (roaming): there is no concept of mobile ip devices in ipv4. therefore, ipv6 builds on mobile ip and provides better support for mobility.","['to support billions of end-systems.\nto reduce routing tables.\nto simplify protocol processing with simplified header.\nto increase security.\nto support real time data traffic (quality of service).\nflow label, traffic class.\nto provide multicasting.\nto support mobility (roaming).\nto be open for change (future): extension headers for additional change incorporation.\nto coexistence with existing protocols.']",correct,1.0,the response answers correct objectives of ipv6 with explanations.

state at least 4 of the differences shown in the lecture between the udp and tcp headers.,"as tcp is much more complex in comparison to udp, it also shows a much more complicated header with more and detailed information about the package and its routing. for example, there are the following four differences between the headers of the two protocols: 
- first of all, tcp includes a sequence number for sending to ensure that all packages can be organized by the receiver in the same order as they were sent. udp does not give any information about the right sequence of packages, so there is no guarantee for the order that the receiver gets or can create.
- furthermore, tcp gives reliability to the users by also including a field for acknowledgements in the header. to be more precise, the included sequence number works as an acknowledgement for a package receiver earlier. on the other hand, udp does not give any guarantee concerning reliability of service, so there is no space in the header for any kind of acknowledgement. 
- what is more, tcp includes possibilities for flow and congestion control by dynamically adjusting the window size for sending and receiving packets at the same time. this process makes use of the “advertised window” field in the header which can be used by a receiver to transmit its optimal window size for reception of packets. udp on the other hand does not include such features, so there is no space for windowing in the header. 
- finally, tcp also gives the user possibilities to prioritize packages for urgent processing at the receiver process. therefore, the header includes the so called 16-bit “urgent pointer” which is an offset to the sequence number and marks the last octet of a sequence of highly prioritized packets. udp does not have any included features for marking urgent data, so there is also no mechanism like the urgent pointer in the udp header.","['possible differences :\nthe upd header (8 bytes) is much shorter than the tcp header (20-60 bytes)\nthe udp header has a fixed length while the tcp header has a variable length\nfields contained in the tcp header and not the udp header :\n-sequence number\n-acknowledgment number\n-reserved\n-flags/control bits\n-advertised window\n-urgent pointer\n-options + padding if the options are\nudp includes the packet length (data + header) while tcp has the header length/data offset (just header) field instead\nthe sender port field is optional in udp, while the source port in tcp is necessary to establish the connection']",correct,1.0,the response correctly identifies four differences between tcp and udp headers.

what are the challenges of mobile routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? please name and describe two challenges.,"in mobile communication, nodes can move, i.e. are not placed on a fixed location, and are transmitting over the air, i.e. they use wireless communication. this stands in big contrast to fixed and wired networks.

to adapt to these new factors, challenges on many different layers occur. whether the discovery of service in the application layer, the specific needs for routing in the network layer, or the control of power used for transmission in the physical layer and even more have to be taken into account to set up such a mobile network.

             -  for mobile routing, the following challenges exist:

                         o   hosts can move and change the attachment to a certain network segment (handover). this handover mechanisms occur in cellular networks and in complex wlan infrastructures as well. for the  example of wlan, handover can be handled at the link layer if both ace points are in the same networks. if there are different networks, a network layer handoff occurs and needs to be considered to implement routing for a seamless service.

                         o   in mobile ad-hoc networks, nodes can disappear due to the radio system and channel characteristics. therefore the network topology may change rapidly and pre-calculated, pro-active routing may fail. in this case, reactive routing maybe of preference, as the route is calculated using the actual network topology.

             - moreover, the general challenges in mobile communication include:

                        o   hidden terminals

                                §  since in mobile communication no wire is used, the nodes can only listen for a certain distance defined by the radio parameters and the channel characteristics, which makes the usage of csma/cd not practicable as the concept of carrier detection (cd) does not work.

                                    an already happening transmission to a certain destination node could not be detected by an intermediate system (is) if the node communicating with the destination node is out of the “listening”-range of the is. to solve this problem the collision will not be “detected” but “avoided” using certain acks (csma/ca, rts/cts).

                       o   exposed terminals

                                 §  when a node wants to send a packet and detects an already existing transmission in its transmission area, it waits until the existing transmission is finished and only thereafter sends its packet to avoid collisions.
                                     this can cause underutilization of a channel if the receiving nodes are far enough away from each other, i.e. beyond the radio range, and therefore both transmissions would not affect each other and could have successfully be completed in parallel.

                       o  near and far terminals

                                  §  if multiple packets arrive at the receiver, they will typically arrive with different signal strengths. depending on the modulation used, the receiver will detect the “stronger” packet and ignore the “weaker” packets if the power difference is large enough. however, fading and multipath may lead to changing power levels and add complexity to the problem.

                                  §  using a multipath receiver design, both packets can be detected as different paths and the receiver may fail to detect these packets. the near/far problem is difficult to solve in direct sequence spread spectrum systems (rake receivers). in ofdm based system, this problem is less severe.","['possible challenges:\n1.adaptation: the network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.security: interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. this may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.medium access control: wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. see the following correct example challenges:\ni)hidden terminal: nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (a and c in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)exposed terminal: nodes (c in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (b) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (b) is out of the detection range of the destination node (d) so that no collision would occur.\niii)near and far terminals: signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.quality of service (qos): due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired qos. additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.scalability: since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.heterogeneity: nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.dependability: providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.power consumption: as most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.']",correct,1.0,the response correctly states the challenges faced in the wireless network.

what are the challenges of mobile routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? please name and describe two challenges.,"there are several challenges that have to be faced for mobile routing. two examples of the problems with this technology are the following:  * hidden terminals mean, that several nodes in the mobile network do not know each other, but they know and transfer to common nodes in the middle. as an example, we can imagine that station a and c does not know about the existence of each other, but does know a station b in the middle. so a and c both try to transmit data to c, where then a collision of data packets occurs.  * exposed terminals: a problem may occur, when to senders are in transmitting range of each other, but they are not able to detect the communication partner of each other. we can easily imagine a situation, where the stations b and c are in close proximity to each other, but where c cannot see b’s partner a and b cannot detect c’s partner d.  if b wants to send data to a, which is not visible to c, c has to wait with its transmission, because he cannot be sure if his partner d is also blocked by b’s communication. in reality, c could send parallel to b, because their transmission partner are out of range of each other. so we have to solve this problem to achieve a better utilization of the channels, reach a higher throughput and enable an overall improved efficiency. * inherent heterogenity: as mobile networks contain several very different nodes, that run different software on very different hardware platforms, one has to think about the capabilities as well as the responsibilities of each node in the network. therefore it is important to work out solutions to varifying capabilities in data processing, routing or transmitting for different participants in the network.  * dynamic source routing: due to the flexibility of mobile networks, where participants / nodes may appear or disappear instantly in very different places, routes are by far less stable and static than in “normal” networks. so one has to implement strategies for route discovery in the routing algorithms, for example the topology-based dynamic source routing in reactive routing protocols.","['possible challenges:\n1.adaptation: the network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.security: interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. this may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.medium access control: wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. see the following correct example challenges:\ni)hidden terminal: nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (a and c in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)exposed terminal: nodes (c in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (b) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (b) is out of the detection range of the destination node (d) so that no collision would occur.\niii)near and far terminals: signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.quality of service (qos): due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired qos. additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.scalability: since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.heterogeneity: nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.dependability: providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.power consumption: as most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.']",correct,1.0,the three stated challenges are correct and complete.

you start slow(cwnd =1)--> if this is ok tan increase a little bit(cwnd = 2) --> wait if it is ok --> increase a little bit(cwnd = 4).....

2. calculate utilisation

arrival rate λ = 9 packets per second
service rate µ = 10 packets per second

utilisation ρ = λ/µ = 9/10 = 0.9

3. calculate probability of system being in requested state:
the requirement of having less than 10 packets in the queue is equivalent to the system not being blocked (full) because of d=n=10. since the distribution is memoryless and we've reached equilibrium, the probability that the system is in a certain state does not depend on the time.
we have a finite queue, so there is a finite set of not-blocking states plus one blocking state.
