0,what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast serve as algorithms for broadcast routing, that is, the routing of messages that should be send to every node of a network. with reverse path forwarding, a node receiving a broadcast packet does forward it to every other adjacent node if it comes from the node the unicast routing would usually use as the next hop to the node which initialized the broadcast. with reverse path broadcast, this behaviour is further refined: again, a broadcast packet is only forwarded by a node b if it comes from the node the unicast routing would usually use as the next hop to the node a which initialized the broadcast, but this time, not to all other adjacent nodes, but only those which would usually receive unicast-packets from a over the current node b.","['purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).']",partially correct,0.8,the response is partially correct as rpf and rpb’s purpose is to reduce the number of duplicates and unnecessary packets in flooding/broadcasting by inspecting the optimal unicast paths. the remaining answer is correct.,correct,1.0,"The student's answer correctly explains the purpose and working of both Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB).

1,what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"reverse path forwarding is a variation of the spanning tree.

each sender has its won spanning tree. so if a node revives something from one of its links it checks the source adress( example :a) and compares with its own table, if it would send something to a: wold i use the same link for that ?

if that is the case the node knows that this is the optimal link for this direction.

→assumtion package used the best rout until now→resend to all edges beside the incoming one.
if that is not the case →assumtion this is not the optimal route →discard the package because it is likely a unnecessary duplicate. 
reverse path broadcasting is similar. but instead of sending it everywhere, after coming from the optimal rout, you send it only to the link that you would use to get to this destination.

2,what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"we learned about reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast regarding broadcast routing. 1. reverse path forwarding / reverse path flooding: the purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. therefore, each sender maintains its own spanning tree. the spanning tree gives us information about how much does it cost to reach a node in a tree to deliver a unicast message. there can be different paths to reach this node from sender to recipient - the cheapest path is considered to be the best one. when a broadcast sender s sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network (see slide 9) every node  in the network checks: is the broadcast message received via the best route the node itself would use to send a unicast message to s? - if it is true: then the node resends the broadcast messages via all edges in the network except the edge over which the broadcast message was received - otherwise the node will ignore the broadcast message (duplicate) 2. reverse path broadcast the purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. it basically works as reverse path forwarding with one difference: when a broadcast sender s sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network, every node selects specific edges which are used to resent the message. a node will resent the message via a specific edge if this node is typcially on the path to this node regarding the sending of unicast messages and if it is the best route until now.","['purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).']",correct,1.0,the response correctly explains the rpf and rpb algorithms and their purpose.,correct,1.0,"the response correctly explains the rpf and rpb algorithms and their purpose, as well as how they work in terms of broadcasting efficiently to minimize duplicate packets in a network.",correct
3,what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"reverse path forwarding (rpf) and  reverse path broadcasting (rpb) are techniques used for multi- and broadcast communication. their purpose is to reduce network load in comparison to more rudimentary approaches for broadcast routing like flooding, by utilizing the information each is can gain from looking at unicast routing paths and therefore only forward packets which are on the best route so far.   in reverse path forwarding, each sender maintains its own spanning tree derived from information gathered during normal unicast operation. if a unicast packet from a to c passes a router b frequently, b knows that it is on the shortest path from a to c and reverse. if, on the other hand, a router d never sees any unicast packets from a to c, or reverse, it knows, that it is not on a shortest path. this information is then used when a flooding packet from a or c (sender) arrives at either c or d (is). only if the is is on the shortest path, it forwards the packet.   reverse path broadcasting is an improvement of reverse path forwarding. not only does it evaluate the shortest path according to the is entry port, where it received the multicast packets like rpf does, but also influences how the packets are then forwarded to the outgoing edges. in contrast to rpf, which just sends the packet over all edges except the incoming one if the packet has arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station are usually sent, i.e. the best route, rpb attempts to send the packet only over suitable edges. namely those edges, from which it usually receives unicast packets in the reverse direction, because that indicates the best possible route.","['purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).']",correct,1.0,the response correctly answers the purpose and the explanation for both broadcast types.,correct,1.0,"The student's answer is correct and provides a detailed explanation of both Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB).

the connection-oriented service has phases of connection and disconnection; connectionless services don't. connection-oriented services establish a connection and verify whether a message is received or not and send again if an error happens, so no losses, duplications, or sequencing errors can occur while connectionless services do not provide such a guarantee. other general difference is that connection-oriented services are flow-based, connectionless are rather message-based.

both confirmed, and unconfirmed connection-less services have no flow control nor connect or disconnect.
the difference between confirmed and unconfirmed connection-less services is in the transmission of data, in unconfirmed services, loss of data units may occur. in confirmed services, however, there are receipts of acknowledged data units. hence, every single frame is acknowledged, with no loss, and if the sender does not receive an acknowledgment within a specific time frame, a timeout and retransmit of data occur.","['1.unconfirmed connectionless - no ack, loss of data possible, no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n2.confirmed connectionless - with ack, no loss of data (timeout and retransmit instead→ duplicates and sequence errors possible), no flow control, no connect or disconnect.\n3.connection-oriented - no data loss, duplication or sequencing errors. instead a 3 phased communication with connect and disconnect, and flow control']",correct,1.0,the response answers the services' names and differences correctly.,correct,1.0,The response correctly names the three service classes offered by the data link layer and explains their differences accurately.,correct

201,what are the challenges of mobile routing compared to routing in fixed and wired networks? please name and describe two challenges.,"csma/cd does not work for wireless transmission. main issue is the broadcast nature of mobile transmission. * hidden terminal problem: firstly, carrier sense fails because a station that want to send cannot “see” another station already  sending to its destination as it is not in the transmission range of the other sending station. secondly, there is no collision detection after the collision arised. this leads to a higher amount of collisions, a wastage of resources and unreliability. for example: * station a sends to station b; station c is not in the range of a, thus, does not receive a’s signal * c performs carrier sensing as it wants to send to b, senses a free medium * c sends to b which causes collision at b; a cannot detect the collision (as it is a wireless scenario) * station a and c are hidden from each other
	 * exposed terminal problem: the “exposed” station is waiting to transmit a signal, as it hears a signal from another transmitting station. thus, it tries to prevent a collision which actually will not occur as the receiver of the other sending station is outside of its range. this leads to underutilization of the channel and a decreased effective throughput. for example: * station b sends to station a; station c wants to send to another station outside of b’s transmission range * c performs carrier sensing and senses a busy medium, thus it has to wait * a is outside of c’s transmission range, thus, c actually does not need to wait as it would not cause a collision at a; c is exposed to b","['possible challenges:\n1.adaptation: the network has to handle the dynamic positioning of the nodes/topology changes. additionally, nodes can leave or join the network anywhere (within signal range) at any time.\n2.security: interception of packets or injection of faulty packages is easily possible in wireless networks. this may necessitate encryption and authentication.\n3.medium access control: wireless networks feature new possibilities for inference and collisions of the transmitted signals. see the following correct example challenges:\ni)hidden terminal: nodes’ transmissions may collide at other nodes without them noticing, because they are out of detection range of each other (a and c in this example) and therefore sense the medium to be free even though there is an overlap of the transmission ranges. \nii)exposed terminal: nodes (c in this example) may not realize they could send collision-free, because a node in their detection range (b) is sending and they, therefore, detect the medium as busy, but the sending node (b) is out of the detection range of the destination node (d) so that no collision would occur.\niii)near and far terminals: signal strength decreases proportionally to the square of distance, so closer nodes may drown out the weaker signals of nodes farther away.\n4.quality of service (qos): due to the rapidly changing network topology, imprecise network information, and resource constraints of participating nodes, it is challenging to provide the desired qos. additionally, signal quality may also decline due to noise and occlusion.\n5.scalability: since it is not possible to know the number of participating nodes beforehand, it is vital that routing protocols, etc. are capable of dealing with increasing network sizes and workloads. \n6.heterogeneity: nodes may have different capabilities, responsibilities, and constraints, e.g. processing capacity, transmission ranges\n7.dependability: providing consistent, performant, and reliable routing behavior that higher-level services can trust is challenging in such a dynamic environment. \n8.power consumption: as most mobile devices are battery-powered, power consumption becomes an important optimization factor in routing, etc.']",correct,1.0,the response correctly states two challenges of mobile routing.,"The student's answer correctly identifies the hidden terminal problem and the exposed terminal problem in wireless networks.

ro = lambda/mu = 9/10.
since we start monitoring the system when it reaches equilibrium, we can use the balance equations to calculate the probabilities for each state. we take the equation for the probability p_n, that the system is in state n = 10, meaning there are 10 packets in the waiting queue, and with n = 10, meaning the buffer size of the waiting queue is 10.
the equation for p_10 is therefore
p_10 = ((1-ro)*ro^10) / (1-ro^11) = 0.0508
now the probability of having less than 10 packets is (1 - p_10), since the normalization condition yields that the sum of all probabilities for the states equals 1, and we can have at most 10 packets in the waiting queue because of the buffer size 10.
therefore, we expect that the fraction of the time, in which we are in state p_10, is (p_10 * t), with t being the examined total time. on the other hand, we expect that the fraction of the time, in which we are not in state p_10, meaning we have less than 10 packets in the waiting queue, is ((1 - p_10) * t).
since we monitor the system for 60 seconds, we have t = 60s.
with the last term we get the result 
((1 - p_10) * 60s) = 56.9512s
therefore, we expect the system to have less than 10 packets in the waiting queue for approximately 56.9512 seconds of the total 60 seconds.","['since we have a buffer size (n) of 10, we will always have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue unless there are exactly 10 packets in the queue. therefore, we first calculate the probability of the system being full/having 10 packets in the queue. this is also called “blocking probability” or p_b.\np_b = ((1 - utilization) * utilization^n) / 1 - utilization^(n+1) = ((1-0.9) * 0.9^10) / (1 - 0.9^11) = 0.0508\nalternatively to the blocking probability, it is also valid to directly calculate p(x less than 10) = (1 -p_b) by summing up the probabilities for 0, 1, …, 9 packets to be in the queue. to calculate the expected time where the system is not blocked in the 60-second observation time-frame, we simply multiply the time frame with p(x less than 10) or the complement of p_b (0.25p) = 60 * (1-p_b) = 56.9512 seconds']",correct,1.0,the response correctly states the non-blocking time and provides a valid justification for the calculation.,"The student's answer is correct and well-justified. They correctly identified the arrival rate (λ) and service rate (μ), calculated the utilization (ρ = λ/μ), and used this to calculate the probability of having exactly 10 packets in the queue (p_10). By subtracting p_10 from 1, they found the probability of having less than 10 packets in the queue. Finally, they multiplied this probability by the total observation time (60 seconds) to find the expected time that the system would have less than 10 packets waiting in the queue.

The student's answer is clear and easy to follow, making it a good response. The only minor improvement I would suggest is to explicitly state that the complement of p_10 (1 - p_10) represents the probability of having less than 10 packets in the queue, as this makes the reasoning more straightforward for readers who may not be familiar with the concept of complementary probabilities.
