0,what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast serve as algorithms for broadcast routing, that is, the routing of messages that should be send to every node of a network. with reverse path forwarding, a node receiving a broadcast packet does forward it to every other adjacent node if it comes from the node the unicast routing would usually use as the next hop to the node which initialized the broadcast. with reverse path broadcast, this behaviour is further refined: again, a broadcast packet is only forwarded by a node b if it comes from the node the unicast routing would usually use as the next hop to the node a which initialized the broadcast, but this time, not to all other adjacent nodes, but only those which would usually receive unicast-packets from a over the current node b.","['purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).']",partially correct,0.8,the response is partially correct as rpf and rpb’s purpose is to reduce the number of duplicates and unnecessary packets in flooding/broadcasting by inspecting the optimal unicast paths. the remaining answer is correct.,correct,1.0,"The student's answer correctly explains the working of both reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast.

1,what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"reverse path forwarding is a variation of the spanning tree.

each sender has its won spanning tree. so if a node revives something from one of its links it checks the source adress( example :a) and compares with its own table, if it would send something to a: wold i use the same link for that ?

if that is the case the node knows that this is the optimal link for this direction.

→assumtion package used the best rout until now→resend to all edges beside the incoming one.
if that is not the case →assumtion this is not the optimal route →discard the package because it is likely a unnecessary duplicate. 
reverse path broadcasting is similar. but instead of sending it everywhere, after coming from the optimal rout, you send it only to the link that you would use to get to this destination.

2,what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"we learned about reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast regarding broadcast routing. 1. reverse path forwarding / reverse path flooding: the purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. therefore, each sender maintains its own spanning tree. the spanning tree gives us information about how much does it cost to reach a node in a tree to deliver a unicast message. there can be different paths to reach this node from sender to recipient - the cheapest path is considered to be the best one. when a broadcast sender s sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network (see slide 9) every node  in the network checks: is the broadcast message received via the best route the node itself would use to send a unicast message to s? - if it is true: then the node resends the broadcast messages via all edges in the network except the edge over which the broadcast message was received - otherwise the node will ignore the broadcast message (duplicate) 2. reverse path broadcast the purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. it basically works as reverse path forwarding with one difference: when a broadcast sender s sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network, every node selects specific edges which are used to resent the message. a node will resent the message via a specific edge if this node is typcially on the path to this node regarding the sending of unicast messages and if it is the best route until now.","['purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).']",correct,1.0,the response correctly explains the rpf and rpb algorithms and their purpose.,correct,1.0,"The student's answer correctly explains the purpose and working of both reverse path forwarding (RPF) and reverse path broadcast (RPBo).

3,what is the purpose of reverse path forwarding and reverse path broadcast? how do they work?,"reverse path forwarding (rpf) and  reverse path broadcasting (rpb) are techniques used for multi- and broadcast communication. their purpose is to reduce network load in comparison to more rudimentary approaches for broadcast routing like flooding, by utilizing the information each is can gain from looking at unicast routing paths and therefore only forward packets which are on the best route so far.   in reverse path forwarding, each sender maintains its own spanning tree derived from information gathered during normal unicast operation. if a unicast packet from a to c passes a router b frequently, b knows that it is on the shortest path from a to c and reverse. if, on the other hand, a router d never sees any unicast packets from a to c, or reverse, it knows, that it is not on a shortest path. this information is then used when a flooding packet from a or c (sender) arrives at either c or d (is). only if the is is on the shortest path, it forwards the packet.   reverse path broadcasting is an improvement of reverse path forwarding. not only does it evaluate the shortest path according to the is entry port, where it received the multicast packets like rpf does, but also influences how the packets are then forwarded to the outgoing edges. in contrast to rpf, which just sends the packet over all edges except the incoming one if the packet has arrived at the is entry port over which the packets for this station are usually sent, i.e. the best route, rpb attempts to send the packet only over suitable edges. namely those edges, from which it usually receives unicast packets in the reverse direction, because that indicates the best possible route.","['purpose: both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.\n\nreverse path forwarding:  each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. when receiving a packet of sender s from neighbor n at node x, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for n) when you would send packets to s over n → the assumption is that the packet used the best route until now.\nreverse path broadcast: nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node x knows that is on the best path between two nodes a and b if it receives unicast packets coming from a and going to b or visa versa. in other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. reverse path broadcasting works identical to reverse path forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to n).']",correct,1.0,the response correctly answers the purpose and the explanation for both broadcast types.,"The student has accurately described Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB). Here's a summary of their explanations:

1. **Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF):** Each node maintains its own spanning tree derived from unicast routing information. When a packet arrives at a router, it checks the routing table to determine if it is on the best path to the destination. If so, it forwards the packet to all adjacent nodes except the one from which it received the packet. This helps reduce network load by preventing duplicate packets and forwarding only on the best route.

2. **Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB):** This is an improvement of RPF. In addition to checking if a packet has arrived on the best path, RPB also considers which edges to use for forwarding. It sends the packet over suitable edges, i.e., those that usually receive unicast packets in the reverse direction because they likely represent the best possible route.

- supports the transmission of isolated, independent frames
- does not support connect or disconnect -> i.e. the sender will simply start sending the frames without caring whether the receiver is ready or not
- does not support flow control
- does not support ack and thus loss of data units can happen: no error correction here.

2) confirmed connectionless service
- does not support connect or disconnect -> i.e. the sender will simply start sending the frames without caring whether the receiver is ready or not
- does not support flow control
- does support ack: no loss of frames since every frame is acknowledged by receiver
- supports timeout and retransmit: if the sender does not receive an ack within a specific time period, the sender will retransmit the data
=> this may cause duplicates and sequence errors

The student's answer is correct, and the justification provided is appropriate. The events are arranged in the increasing order of their likelihood (least probable to most probable): b -> c -> a.

Explanation:

* Event b: you see the sequence hhhttt. This event is a specific sequence of six flips, so it has a lower probability than event c or a. The probability of this event can be calculated as follows: p(b) = 0.6^3 * 0.4^3 = 0.013824
* Event c: you see at least three heads (or three tails). This event is more general than event b, so it has a higher probability. The probability of this event can be calculated as follows: p(c) = (6 choose 3) * (0.6^3 * 0.4^3) + (6 choose 4) * (0.6^4 * 0.4^2) + (6 choose 5) * (0.6^5 * 0.4^1) + (6 choose 6) * (0.6^6 * 0.4^0) = 0.27648
* Event a: you see at least three heads or tails. This event is more general than event c, so it has an even higher probability. The probability of this event can be calculated as follows: p(a) = (6 choose 3) * (0.6^3 * 0.4^3) + (6 choose 4) * (0.6^4 * 0.4^2) + (6 choose 5) * (0.6^5 * 0.4^1) + (6 choose 6) * (0.6^6 * 0.4^0) = 0.8208

1. Hidden Terminals: This issue arises when nodes are out of each other's transmission range, causing them to be invisible to one another. When they need to communicate, they have to do so through a third node within the range of both. The problem occurs because the nodes cannot determine if the other node is sending something at the same time, leading to potential collisions.

2. Near and Far Terminals: This challenge appears when two nodes are transmitting signals simultaneously. In this case, the stronger signal will overpower the weaker one, making it impossible for the receiver to receive the weaker signal.

ro = lambda/mu = 9/10.
since we start monitoring the system when it reaches equilibrium, we can use the balance equations to calculate the probabilities for each state. we take the equation for the probability p_n, that the system is in state n = 10, meaning there are 10 packets in the waiting queue, and with n = 10, meaning the buffer size of the waiting queue is 10.
the equation for p_10 is therefore
p_10 = ((1-ro)*ro^10) / (1-ro^11) = 0.0508
now the probability of having less than 10 packets is (1 - p_10), since the normalization condition yields that the sum of all probabilities for the states equals 1, and we can have at most 10 packets in the waiting queue because of the buffer size 10.
therefore, we expect that the fraction of the time, in which we are in state p_10, is (p_10 * t), with t being the examined total time. on the other hand, we expect that the fraction of the time, in which we are not in state p_10, meaning we have less than 10 packets in the waiting queue, is ((1 - p_10) * t).
