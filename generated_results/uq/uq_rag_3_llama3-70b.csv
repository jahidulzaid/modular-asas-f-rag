- first of all, the network control logic can be easily changed and updated, since the administrator does not has to change the logic in all hardcoded (sic!) switches (like in classic networks), but only the software of the control units in the control plane. this plane then communicates the new rules to all switches. 
- as it can be concluded from the answer before, the switches at all get less complex and therefore cheaper, since they don’t have to include a complex control logic anymore. they get the entries of their forwarding tables by the control plane and don’t have to figure them out by themselves. 

of course, there are also disadvantages of software defined networking: 
- security protection is a major concern in sdn since the complete control logic of the network is centralized in the control plane. so the systems running the control plane gets an interesting target for attacks in order to take over control in the network. 
- in order to establish sdn, the existing network needs to be completely reconfigurated - new control units for the control plane and improved switches that can receive control configurations by the control plane. this requires a high investment in the network to get the sdn running.","['benefits:\n● reduced complexity of the switches: they only have to act according to their flow\ntables and do not have to make any local routing decisions.\n● due to centralized routing, the routing can converge way faster to a global optimum\nthan with decentralized routing because of a global view\n● better integration of application and network provides a better global view of the\nsystem.\n● increased flexibility :\n1. we can update the routing logic on the fly, routers/switches are not limited\nto hard-coded routing algorithms anymore (note: this is also possible with\nprogrammable switches).\n2. api to “program” the network: software (application) “defines” the\nnetwork\n3. high-level programming languages for implementation of logic and making\nuse of powerful integrated development environments.\nnote: in case the reasoning/example sufficiently explains the benefit, naming like reduced\ncomplexity, increased flexibility can be omitted and response can still be granted 0.25 for\neach benefit.\n\ndrawbacks:\n● high complexity of the control servers: they have to make all the routing decisions\nfor the (sub)network and can therefore be a bottleneck.\n● centralized routing in distributed systems in general: the routing completely depends\non the control server(s). to achieve better availability and fault tolerance, the number\nof control servers can be increased. however, this can lead to synchronization and\nconsistency issues. → cap problem (consistency, availability, partition tolerance)\n● new technology adoption challenges:\n● switching to sdn from traditional networking.\n● training personnel on sdn.\nall these will cost depending on the reconfiguration level but then for the long term, it\ndepends upon the roi.\n● security-related concerns :\n○ lack of hardware security: eliminating the use of the physical routers and\nswitches, one also loses the security that comes with it.']",correct,1.0,the response correctly states the benefits and drawbacks of sdn over traditional networking.,correct,1.0,"the response answers two benefits and two drawbacks of SDN compared to traditional networking correctly.

The student's answer is mostly accurate and well-structured, but there are some minor errors and omissions.

**Benefits:**

1. The student correctly identifies the benefit of flexibility in SDN, citing the ability to change logic using high-level programming languages without requiring new hardware.
2. The student also correctly identifies the benefit of reduced complexity in switches, as control logic is handled by servers with more available performance.

**Drawbacks:**

1. The student accurately describes the CAP problem, noting that SDN can only achieve two of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance at a time.
2. The student correctly notes the increased complexity of controllers in SDN, particularly in distributed networks where they must handle communication with each other.

**Reasoning:**

The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of SDN. However, there are some minor errors and omissions:

* The student does not mention the API benefit or the ability to ""program"" the network.
* The student does not explicitly mention the security-related concerns, such as the lack of hardware security.
