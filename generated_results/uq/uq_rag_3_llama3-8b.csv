of course, there are also disadvantages of software defined networking: 
- security protection is a major concern in sdn since the complete control logic of the network is centralized in the control plane. so the systems running the control plane gets an interesting target for attacks in order to take over control in the network. 
- in order to establish sdn, the existing network needs to be completely reconfigurated - new control units for the control plane and improved switches that can receive control configurations by the control plane. this requires a high investment in the network to get the sdn running.","['benefits:\n● reduced complexity of the switches: they only have to act according to their flow\ntables and do not have to make any local routing decisions.\n● due to centralized routing, the routing can converge way faster to a global optimum\nthan with decentralized routing because of a global view\n● better integration of application and network provides a better global view of the\nsystem.\n● increased flexibility :\n1. we can update the routing logic on the fly, routers/switches are not limited\nto hard-coded routing algorithms anymore (note: this is also possible with\nprogrammable switches).\n2. api to “program” the network: software (application) “defines” the\nnetwork\n3. high-level programming languages for implementation of logic and making\nuse of powerful integrated development environments.\nnote: in case the reasoning/example sufficiently explains the benefit, naming like reduced\ncomplexity, increased flexibility can be omitted and response can still be granted 0.25 for\neach benefit.\n\ndrawbacks:\n● high complexity of the control servers: they have to make all the routing decisions\nfor the (sub)network and can therefore be a bottleneck.\n● centralized routing in distributed systems in general: the routing completely depends\non the control server(s). to achieve better availability and fault tolerance, the number\nof control servers can be increased. however, this can lead to synchronization and\nconsistency issues. → cap problem (consistency, availability, partition tolerance)\n● new technology adoption challenges:\n● switching to sdn from traditional networking.\n● training personnel on sdn.\nall these will cost depending on the reconfiguration level but then for the long term, it\ndepends upon the roi.\n● security-related concerns :\n○ lack of hardware security: eliminating the use of the physical routers and\nswitches, one also loses the security that comes with it.']",correct,1.0,the response correctly states the benefits and drawbacks of sdn over traditional networking.,correct,1.0,The student's answer accurately describes two benefits of SDN compared to traditional networking: reduced complexity and centralized routing.
