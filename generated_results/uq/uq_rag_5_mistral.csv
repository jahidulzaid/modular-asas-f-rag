- security protection is a major concern in sdn since the complete control logic of the network is centralized in the control plane. so the systems running the control plane gets an interesting target for attacks in order to take over control in the network.

	+ SDN scales better for growing architectures because the control plane is centralized, making it easier to manage large networks. Additionally, high-level programming languages can be used for implementation, which makes it easier to develop and deploy new features.
* Drawbacks:
	+ One of the main disadvantages of SDN is that it requires controllers, which can become a bottleneck in large networks. This means that the performance of the network may suffer if the controller is not powerful enough or if there are too many devices to manage.

reduced switch complexity: by moving as much control logic away from each switch to e.g. a control server the switches are more restricted and won’t have to manage all on their own. this reduces the necessary complexity of the switches by maintaining the same level of performance.

reliability: if the control server implementing the control logic for the network breaks the whole network will go down.
