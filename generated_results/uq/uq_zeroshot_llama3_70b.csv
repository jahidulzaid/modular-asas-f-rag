one benefit of sdn over traditional networking is, that as the logic is no more ""hard-coded"" in the routing process of each switch but an exchangeable software the network control logic can easily be modified without having to access physical routers. 
another benefit of sdn is, that as the control logic is hosted on an external, logically centralized server, routers do not have to have a routing process and their complexity can therefore be reduced while maintaining the performance of forwarding in hardware.

drawbacks:
firstly, a controller with both a northbound interface to the control logic as well as a southbound interface to the data plane has to be implemented which is hard, as a lot of the overhead has been shifted to the controller. 
secondly, as the control logic is no longer in every router, if a controller in the control plane fails or breaks down, all routers which draw their information from that controller are not longer usable until the controller has been fixed or another controller takes over. furthermore, information loss during the downtime can be a big factor.","['benefits:\n● reduced complexity of the switches: they only have to act according to their flow\ntables and do not have to make any local routing decisions.\n● due to centralized routing, the routing can converge way faster to a global optimum\nthan with decentralized routing because of a global view\n● better integration of application and network provides a better global view of the\nsystem.\n● increased flexibility :\n1. we can update the routing logic on the fly, routers/switches are not limited\nto hard-coded routing algorithms anymore (note: this is also possible with\nprogrammable switches).\n2. api to “program” the network: software (application) “defines” the\nnetwork\n3. high-level programming languages for implementation of logic and making\nuse of powerful integrated development environments.\nnote: in case the reasoning/example sufficiently explains the benefit, naming like reduced\ncomplexity, increased flexibility can be omitted and response can still be granted 0.25 for\neach benefit.\n\ndrawbacks:\n● high complexity of the control servers: they have to make all the routing decisions\nfor the (sub)network and can therefore be a bottleneck.\n● centralized routing in distributed systems in general: the routing completely depends\non the control server(s). to achieve better availability and fault tolerance, the number\nof control servers can be increased. however, this can lead to synchronization and\nconsistency issues. → cap problem (consistency, availability, partition tolerance)\n● new technology adoption challenges:\n● switching to sdn from traditional networking.\n● training personnel on sdn.\nall these will cost depending on the reconfiguration level but then for the long term, it\ndepends upon the roi.\n● security-related concerns :\n○ lack of hardware security: eliminating the use of the physical routers and\nswitches, one also loses the security that comes with it.']",correct,1.0,the response correctly states the benefits and drawbacks of sdn over traditional networking.,Correct,1.0,"The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of SDN compared to traditional networking.

a primary advantage of sdn networking is greater visibility throughout the network. in traditional networking, any security that impacts traffic is overarching. with sdn, it's granular. this means that engineers can selectively block malicious traffic throughout your network on a granular basis.

[1] traditional network infrastructure has limited flexibility. sdn controller helps and assists with easy modification of the network control logic - from “hard-coded” logic to exchangeable software. this would enable to program the network at a higher level - “think of it as a general language or an instruction set that let’s me write a control program for the network rather than having to rewrite all of code on each individual router,” - scott shenker
[2] it helps to reduce switching complexity by removing control logic from switch and host it on servers, and this happens while preserving same forwarding performance.

drawbacks:
[1] since functionalities of routers and switches are provided through controller, controller can be vulnerable to security attacks, therefore added extra security features can be an overhead.

144,"what are the benefits and drawbacks of sdn compared to traditional networking,where each switch/router has to manage forwarding and routing on its own? describe two benefits and two drawbacks in 1-2 sentences each. ","two of the main benefits of sdn are the following ones: 
- first of all, the network control logic can be easily changed and updated, since the administrator does not has to change the logic in all hardcoded (sic!) switches (like in classic networks), but only the software of the control units in the control plane. this plane then communicates the new rules to all switches. 
- as it can be concluded from the answer before, the switches at all get less complex and therefore cheaper, since they don’t have to include a complex control logic anymore. they get the entries of their forwarding tables by the control plane and don’t have to figure them out by themselves. 

of course, there are also disadvantages of software defined networking: 
- security protection is a major concern in sdn since the complete control logic of the network is centralized in the control plane. so the systems running the control plane gets an interesting target for attacks in order to take over control in the network.
