a primary advantage of sdn networking is greater visibility throughout the network. in traditional networking, any security that impacts traffic is overarching. with sdn, it's granular. this means that engineers can selectively block malicious traffic throughout your network on a granular basis.

one of the problems with virtualizing any infrastructure is the latency that arises as a result. the speed of the interaction with an appliance is dependent on how many virtualized resources are available. 

one of the most significant security risk factors is the possibility of a compromised sdn controller attack at the control plane layer. due to the centralization design of the sdn, the sdn controller becomes the brain of the sdn architecture. attackers can focus on compromising the sdn controller in an attempt to manipulate the entire network.","['benefits:\n● reduced complexity of the switches: they only have to act according to their flow\ntables and do not have to make any local routing decisions.\n● due to centralized routing, the routing can converge way faster to a global optimum\nthan with decentralized routing because of a global view\n● better integration of application and network provides a better global view of the\nsystem.\n● increased flexibility :\n1. we can update the routing logic on the fly, routers/switches are not limited\nto hard-coded routing algorithms anymore (note: this is also possible with\nprogrammable switches).\n2. api to “program” the network: software (application) “defines” the\nnetwork\n3. high-level programming languages for implementation of logic and making\nuse of powerful integrated development environments.\nnote: in case the reasoning/example sufficiently explains the benefit, naming like reduced\ncomplexity, increased flexibility can be omitted and response can still be granted 0.25 for\neach benefit.\n\ndrawbacks:\n● high complexity of the control servers: they have to make all the routing decisions\nfor the (sub)network and can therefore be a bottleneck.\n● centralized routing in distributed systems in general: the routing completely depends\non the control server(s). to achieve better availability and fault tolerance, the number\nof control servers can be increased. however, this can lead to synchronization and\nconsistency issues. → cap problem (consistency, availability, partition tolerance)\n● new technology adoption challenges:\n● switching to sdn from traditional networking.\n● training personnel on sdn.\nall these will cost depending on the reconfiguration level but then for the long term, it\ndepends upon the roi.\n● security-related concerns :\n○ lack of hardware security: eliminating the use of the physical routers and\nswitches, one also loses the security that comes with it.']",correct,1.0,the response correctly states the benefits and drawbacks of sdn over traditional networking.,Correct,1.0,"The student's answer accurately describes two benefits (granular security and centralized management) and two drawbacks (latency and security risk factors due to centralization) of SDN compared to traditional networking, providing a clear explanation for each point.

in traditional networking, each switch must maintain its own routing table and compute the path forward, this slows down packet forwarding. 
sdn maintains logical centralization and physical distribution, the logical centralization helps to maintain a consistent global view of the network, the physical distribution ensures that if one component of the system fails, other components can jump in and take over without the system being affected, ie, high availability, and scalability.

- first of all, the network control logic can be easily changed and updated, since the administrator does not has to change the logic in all hardcoded (sic!) switches (like in classic networks), but only the software of the control units in the control plane. this plane then communicates the new rules to all switches. 
- as it can be concluded from the answer before, the switches at all get less complex and therefore cheaper, since they don’t have to include a complex control logic anymore. they get the entries of their forwarding tables by the control plane and don’t have to figure them out by themselves. 

of course, there are also disadvantages of software defined networking: 
- security protection is a major concern in sdn since the complete control logic of the network is centralized in the control plane. so the systems running the control plane gets an interesting target for attacks in order to take over control in the network. 
- in order to establish sdn, the existing network needs to be completely reconfigurated - new control units for the control plane and improved switches that can receive control configurations by the control plane. this requires a high investment in the network to get the sdn running.","['benefits:\n● reduced complexity of the switches: they only have to act according to their flow\ntables and do not have to make any local routing decisions.\n● due to centralized routing, the routing can converge way faster to a global optimum\nthan with decentralized routing because of a global view\n● better integration of application and network provides a better global view of the\nsystem.\n● increased flexibility :\n1. we can update the routing logic on the fly, routers/switches are not limited\nto hard-coded routing algorithms anymore (note: this is also possible with\nprogrammable switches).\n2. api to “program” the network: software (application) “defines” the\nnetwork\n3. high-level programming languages for implementation of logic and making\nuse of powerful integrated development environments.\nnote: in case the reasoning/example sufficiently explains the benefit, naming like reduced\ncomplexity, increased flexibility can be omitted and response can still be granted 0.25 for\neach benefit.\n\ndrawbacks:\n● high complexity of the control servers: they have to make all the routing decisions\nfor the (sub)network and can therefore be a bottleneck.\n● centralized routing in distributed systems in general: the routing completely depends\non the control server(s). to achieve better availability and fault tolerance, the number\nof control servers can be increased. however, this can lead to synchronization and\nconsistency issues. → cap problem (consistency, availability, partition tolerance)\n● new technology adoption challenges:\n● switching to sdn from traditional networking.\n● training personnel on sdn.\nall these will cost depending on the reconfiguration level but then for the long term, it\ndepends upon the roi.\n● security-related concerns :\n○ lack of hardware security: eliminating the use of the physical routers and\nswitches, one also loses the security that comes with it.']",correct,1.0,the response correctly states the benefits and drawbacks of sdn over traditional networking.,Correct,1.0,"The student's answer accurately describes two benefits (reduced complexity and easier updates) and two drawbacks (security concerns and high investment for adoption) of SDN compared to traditional networking, in line with the reference answer.
